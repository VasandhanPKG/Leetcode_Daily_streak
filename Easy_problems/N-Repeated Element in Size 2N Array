# N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array (2026-01-01)

## 📸 Problem Illustration



## Problem Overview

You are given an integer array `nums` of size `2 * n`.

The array contains:
- `n + 1` unique numbers
- One number that is repeated exactly `n` times

---

## Key Hint

Since the size of the array is `2 * n` and there are `n + 1` unique numbers,
there must be **only one number that repeats**.

This observation helps narrow the problem down to simply identifying
the repeating element.

---

## Approach

Based on the above reasoning, the goal is to **find the first number
that appears more than once**.

To do this:
- Traverse the array once
- Keep track of elements already seen
- The first repeated element encountered is the answer

---

## Algorithm

1. Create an empty `HashSet`
2. Iterate through each element in the array
3. If the element already exists in the set, return it
4. Otherwise, add the element to the set

---

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

---

## Language Used

- Java
